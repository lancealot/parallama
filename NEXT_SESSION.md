## Implementation Plan

1. Token Counting
```python
class TokenCounter:
    async def count_tokens(self, text: str, model: str) -> int:
        # Implement token counting logic
        pass

    async def estimate_streaming_tokens(self, stream: AsyncGenerator) -> int:
        # Implement streaming token estimation
        pass
```

2. Additional Endpoints
```python
class OpenAIGateway:
    async def handle_embeddings(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        # Implement embeddings endpoint
        pass

    async def handle_edits(self, request: Request) -> Response:
        # Implement edits endpoint
        pass
```

## Key Considerations

1. API Compatibility
   - Full OpenAI API spec compliance
   - Backward compatibility
   - Feature parity where possible
   - Graceful fallbacks

2. Performance
   - Response time optimization
   - Memory efficiency
   - Connection management
   - Error recovery

3. Testing
   - Token counting accuracy
   - Endpoint compatibility
   - Error handling coverage
   - Performance benchmarks

## Development Environment

Required packages:
```bash
pip install tiktoken httpx pytest-asyncio
```

## Testing Plan

1. Token Counting Tests
```python
async def test_token_counting():
    # Test accuracy
    # Test streaming estimation
    # Test different models
    pass
```

2. New Endpoint Tests
```python
async def test_embeddings():
    # Test request format
    # Test response format
    # Test error cases
    pass
```
