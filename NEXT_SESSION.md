# Next Development Session: Gateway Implementation

## Completed Items

1. Database Models Implementation
- Created SQLAlchemy models:
  * User model with password hashing (bcrypt)
  * API Key model with secure key generation
  * Refresh Token model with rotation support
  * Role and UserRole models for RBAC
  * Gateway Rate Limits model for usage tracking
- Set up database connection management with connection pooling
- Implemented Alembic migrations for schema management

2. Authentication Service Implementation
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation
- Added configuration support for JWT settings
- Created comprehensive test suite for token management
- Set up error handling for token operations
- Implemented refresh token system with:
  * Token rotation
  * Reuse detection
  * Rate limiting
  * Chain revocation
- Completed and verified all authentication tests

3. API Key Management Service Implementation
- Implemented secure API key generation and storage
- Added Redis caching for key verification
- Created key revocation system with cache invalidation
- Implemented key listing with metadata
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all operations

4. Role-Based Access Control Implementation
- Created Role and UserRole models
- Implemented role management service
- Added permission system
- Integrated roles with authentication
- Added role-based test coverage

5. Authentication Middleware Implementation
- Implemented JWT token validation middleware
- Implemented API key validation middleware
- Added role-based access control middleware with:
  * Single permission checks
  * Any-of permission checks
  * All-of permission checks
- Added comprehensive error handling
- Completed test coverage for all middleware components
- Migrated to src-layout package structure for better organization

## Next Focus Areas

1. Initial Gateway Implementation
- Create base gateway interface
- Implement gateway router and registry
- Set up discovery endpoint
- Implement Ollama native gateway
- Implement OpenAI compatibility gateway

## Implementation Order

1. Gateway Interface
```python
class LLMGateway(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def validate_auth(self, credentials: str) -> bool:
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    async def transform_request(self, request: dict) -> dict:
        pass
```

## Key Considerations

1. Security
- Proper JWT configuration
- Secure token handling
- Rate limiting on auth endpoints
- Input validation

2. Performance
- Token caching
- Connection pooling
- Async operations

3. Testing
- Unit tests for middleware
- Integration tests for endpoints
- Security testing

4. Documentation
- API documentation updates
- Security guidelines
- Usage examples

## Development Environment

Required packages:
```bash
pip install "fastapi[all]" sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt] python-multipart alembic
```

## Testing Plan

1. Middleware Tests
```python
def test_auth_middleware():
    # Test token validation
    # Test permission checking
    pass

def test_gateway_routing():
    # Test request routing
    pass
```

## Expected Outcomes

1. Working middleware system with:
- Token validation
- Permission checking
- Error handling

2. Initial gateway system with:
- Request routing
- Model mapping
- Response transformation

3. Updated documentation reflecting new features

4. Comprehensive test coverage
