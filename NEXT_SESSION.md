- Implemented token counting and request tracking
- Added per-model and per-user rate limits
- Set up usage tracking and logging
- Created database models and migrations
- Added FastAPI middleware for request handling
- Added comprehensive test coverage:
  * Unit tests for rate limiting service
  * Integration tests for middleware
  * Redis integration tests
  * Error handling and logging tests
- Implemented Redis mock for testing

- Added per-gateway and shared limits

## Next Focus Areas

1. OpenAI Compatibility Gateway
- Create OpenAIGateway class
- Implement model mapping
- Add request format conversion
- Set up response transformation
- Add streaming support

## Implementation Order

1. OpenAI Gateway
```python
class OpenAIGateway(LLMGateway):
    async def transform_request(self, request: Request) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Transform to OpenAI format
        pass
    
    async def transform_response(self, response: Dict[str, Any]) -> Response:
        # Transform to OpenAI format
        pass
```

## Key Considerations

1. OpenAI Compatibility
- Model mapping
- Parameter conversion
- Response format standardization
- Error handling

2. Testing
- OpenAI gateway tests
- Integration tests
- Performance testing

## Development Environment

Required packages:
```bash
pip install redis aioredis prometheus-client
```

## Testing Plan

1. OpenAI Gateway Tests
```python
def test_openai_gateway():
    # Test model mapping
    # Test format conversion
    # Test streaming support
    pass
```

## Expected Outcomes

1. Working OpenAI Gateway:
- Compatible API
- Model mapping
- Format conversion
- Streaming support

2. Updated Documentation:
- OpenAI compatibility notes
- Configuration examples

3. Comprehensive Tests:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
