  * Error handling tests

## Current Focus: Rate Limit Testing

Working on fixing test failures in rate limiting:
1. test_rate_limit_middleware_exceeded
2. test_rate_limit_middleware_error_logging
3. test_rate_limit_middleware_redis_error
4. test_rate_limit_middleware_request_timing

Issues being addressed:
- Rate limit check timing
- Redis mock response format
- Error handling and logging
- Request timing tracking

## Next Focus Areas

1. OpenAI Compatibility Gateway
- Create OpenAIGateway class
- Implement model mapping
- Add request format conversion
- Set up response transformation
- Add streaming support

## Implementation Order

1. OpenAI Gateway
```python
class OpenAIGateway(LLMGateway):
    async def transform_request(self, request: Request) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Transform to OpenAI format
        pass
    
    async def transform_response(self, response: Dict[str, Any]) -> Response:
        # Transform to OpenAI format
        pass
```

## Key Considerations

1. OpenAI Compatibility
- Model mapping
- Parameter conversion
- Response format standardization
- Error handling

2. Testing
- OpenAI gateway tests
- Integration tests
- Performance testing

## Development Environment

Required packages:
```bash
pip install redis aioredis prometheus-client
```

## Testing Plan

1. OpenAI Gateway Tests
```python
def test_openai_gateway():
    # Test model mapping
    # Test format conversion
    # Test streaming support
    pass
```

## Expected Outcomes

1. Working OpenAI Gateway:
- Compatible API
- Model mapping
- Format conversion
- Streaming support

2. Updated Documentation:
- OpenAI compatibility notes
- Configuration examples

3. Comprehensive Tests:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Performance tests
